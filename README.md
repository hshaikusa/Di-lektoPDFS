"# DialektoPDFS" 
## Simple rag application built on open source pretrained LLM, for day to day use to understand the papers, articles and any PDF documents. 
## The application can be used to find relevant information quickly. It can also be used to quickly scan through a page to get an understanding of the main points.
## Additionally, it can be used to take notes and save for later review. This is used for my own use and sharing for everyone. The app is free to use and easy to install.
## It is regularly updated and improved. Feedback is welcome and encouraged.
